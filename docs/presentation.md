# Agenda

## Metaclasses

###
*Metaclasses are deeper magic than 99 of users should ever worry about.
If you wonder whether you need them, you donâ€™t.*\
\hfill --Time Peters

### Data model 'uses for'

- *Common uses for sets...*, an entry
- *Uses for metaclasses*, an subsubsection

## Set as datatype

### perlfaq: How can I remove duplicate elements from a list or array?

```perl
my @unique = keys { map { $_, 1 } @data };
```

### perlfaq: How do I sort an array by (anything)?

```perl
# Schwartzian Transform
my @sorted = map  { $_->[0] }
    sort { $a->[1] cmp $b->[1] }
    map  { [ $_, uc( (/\d+\s*(\S+)/)[0]) ] } @data;
```

# Gilded Rose Kata

## Introduction

- `Gilded Rose` is a small inn ran by Allison
- Trade finest goods on the side
- Inventory system was implemented by Leeroy, who moved on to new adventures

## Requirements


# Sample slides

## Overalys

\only<1,3>{
This text appears on the first and third versions of the slide, but not the second.
INSIDE HERE YOU USE ANY LATEX
INSTEAD OF only you can use onslide etc
}

This uses beamer's highlighting command to \alert<2>{draw attention here}, but only on the second slide.

\note<2>{

Notes can also have overlay specs.
}

## Include image

![Flow chart](img/Untitled 1.png){ width=250px }


## Code

```jsx
Bot.send("Are you going out to play?")
async function respond(inputText){
    if (inputText == "yes"){
        Bot.send("Wear a hat");
    }
    else {
        Bot.send("ok");
    }

 }
```

What we learned. - Bot.send() method - if else statements.

## Math

The well known Pythagorean theorem $x^2 + y^2 = z^2$ was  proved to be invalid for other exponents.
Meaning the next equation has no integer solutions:
$$x^n + y^n = z^n$$

Can AI, help find near misses for this equation?
